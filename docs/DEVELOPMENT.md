# Development

## Pre-Commit Checks

The repository includes `.githooks/pre-commit`. The hook runs:

```bash
npm run precommit
```

That command runs lint, type-check, and tests. `npm install` runs the `prepare` script, which configures Git to use `.githooks` when the directory is a Git repository. In non-Git environments it exits cleanly.

Manual setup:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Useful Commands

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev:api
npm run dev:worker
```
